-- This is a list of things that need to be done.  Please update this if you have added or 
--   fixed any of the things listed below.


Hachiryu Haramaki Set - need to find a way to add Store TP (Any two pieces of this set grant +5 Store TP, while three grant +10 Store TP, and finally, all four grant +20 Store TP.)

Commodore Frac/+1 - Random Deal has an increases success rate with one JA waitting on recast and a small chance to restore 2 job ablities with more than one job ability waitting on recast

Pantin Tobe/+1 - Automaton: Accuracy + 10 no code for automation yet.

eerie cloak +1 - need to add a check for night time and job lvl of a muitiple of 13 so refresh effect will activate

Notorious monster tp moves need a way to be implemented. The current system links all mob skill(tp moves) by family ID only and therefore any monster in that family can use all moves for that family.
  As-is if you add a move that should only be useable by an NM any other monster that is in the same family will have access to the move. I did notice a flag but it seems to be a 2 bit value which would not
	allow eficient room for all NM type moves. 

BCNM's do not set restrictions to players like no subjob when you set the bit properly in the sql file "bcnm_info".
	Example: Shattering stars (Maat fight)
