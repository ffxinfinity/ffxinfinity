Final Fantasy XI Private Server

This is the server code that was used while running the ffxinfinity.com private server.  All code has been uploaded in it's last stable form and is available for use.  This again is only the server code and will only allow you to host a private server.  This will not allow you to play FFXI.  In order to play FFXI you will need a copy of FFXI from Square Enix.  We will not be provided the software needed to play FFXI. This code base has been set up in such a way that all servers can be found in one solution file.  Opening this solution file will allow you to work on any of the mandatory three servers and will allow you to build all three servers in one solution.  In order to develop any part of the following solution it is recommended that Visual Studio 2010 or above is used with a mysql backend database.  When building the solution a dump folder will be created with all the files needed to deploy a working private server.  This code is provided as is with no support and we do not hold any responsibility on how it is used or what it may do to your servers.
